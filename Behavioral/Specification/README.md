# Specification
Specification pattern is a pattern that allows us to encapsulate some piece of domain knowledge into a single unit - specification - and reuse it in different parts of the code base.


The basic idea behind this pattern is that when you have some piece of domain knowledge you can encapsulate this knowledge into a single unit, specification, and then reuse in different parts of your code base
## Use cases

- In-memory validation
- Retrieving data from the database
- Construction-to-order

## Advantages

- Avoid domain knowledge duplication
- Enables declarative approach
