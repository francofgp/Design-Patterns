# Strategy 

Select an implementation at runtime based on user input without having to extend the class

The singleton pattern make the class itself responsible for enforcing Singleton behavior


## What did we achieve

- A more extensible, object oriented and dynamic implementation
- Easily add new strategies without affecting existing ones
- Cleaner approach with single responsibility in mind
- Decouple your code and achieve a cleaner, more extensible code base


**Whenever you inject an interface to allow change of behavior you are leveraging the strategy pattern**

There are several examples in this folder, it is an example about calculate the tax for an order based on different strategies
