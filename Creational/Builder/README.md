# Builder
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations


Abstracts out initialization code

Representations created as concrete classes
- Constructed from interface blueprint


Director class handles actual object creation
- Controls where & what data is used

## When to use it

- Builder is useful when creating complex objects
- When object creation needs to be separate from its assembly
- When different representations need to be created with finer control


## Keep in mind
- Not for everything - itâ€™s overkill for most classes where subclassing, refactoring, or abstracted interfaces would be a better solution
- Bloated class constructors are a dead giveaway
- Lots of computation logic in class constructors needed to set class field values
- Finite number of related classes that perform similar functions with different representations

## Implications

- Lets you vary a products internal representation
- It isolates code for construction and representation
- It gives you finer control over the construction process
- Shares similarities with the Factory pattern
